      <!-- <h1 class="title">Dear Jenny,</h1> -->
      <p>
        Dear Sophia,
      </p>
      <p>
        You are the girl who lived—</br>
        the girl who lived with her heart outside of
        her ribcages.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are the girl who doesn't wear a coat,</br>
        never carries an umbrella,</br>
        living so fully that you feel every day like it's Coachella.
      </p>
      <p>
        For you, rain is nature's music on full blast,</br>
        it's tempo marking simply reads "fast".</br>
        And before it's past nine,</br>
        you'll ask those new strangers to dine,</br>
        and afterwards we'll all dance,</br>
        like it's our last chance.
      </p>
      <p>
        And when you sing, you taste the high notes,</br>
        like they're as savory as oats,</br>
        and you feel the low notes,</br>
        <em>trembling</em> through your body</br>
        like they're the powerful engines of large boats,</br>
        just like the kind that you use to sail the seas on all of your adventures
        across the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are the girl whom I'm am lucky enough to call my friend,</br>
        the one who's always there in the end.</br>
        You send me care packages,</br>
        not by way of mail,</br>
        and they can't be measured on a scale,</br>
        but when I'm off the rail,</br>
        your words remind me what matters,</br>
        and help me grind through the chatter</br>
        that knaws constantly at my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sophia, you are magnificent.</br>
        Thank you for feeling.</br>
        Thank your for your daring.</br>
        Thank you for your loving.</br>
        Please keep your heart out—for all of us.</br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Love,</br>
        Jonathan
