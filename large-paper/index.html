    <h1 class="title">Large Paper</h1>

    <div class="description">
      <p>Star ran in through the door of their hotel room in Hong Kong. As she raced past her dads, she shouted what sounded like what was an obligatory "Hello". Her bag was emitting an audible clanking of metal as it bounced up and down.</p>
      <p>Ky ran to the back of the room and bellowed "Ky, I found the disks!"</p>
      <p>Her sister Ky quickly turned her head back to glance at start with one eyebrow raised: "Frakin mars, no you didn't!". Star replied, "Oh yes I did—plug it in"... Triumphantly, Star took took an ancient looking metal box shaped item shape and placed it gently and somehow emphatically on the table.</p>

      <p>This was Star's fourth trip back from the junkyard. In her American history class in school, she had learned about how computer infrastructure of the early part of the century was built on cloud infrastructure. After doing some more research herself, she realized that the way this all worked is that there were these large companies that would put a bunch of computers into one warehouse and other people would pay to use them.</p>

      <p>Since Star was in the 6th grade, she was always fascinated by this history of computing and how it evolved from the 19th century all the way until now. When they learned about how the early Internet worked, she was fascinated. Her teacher still remembers the moment when Star just exclaimed with Skepticism and a little bit of pain, "Mr. Carvey, this is ridiculous. People would actually sit at tables and stare at a small portions of giant pieces of paper that they couldn't touch and had to tap their fingers on these 'keyboards'—That's ridiculous, how could they get kids to sit still for that long? How did they just stare at tiny pieces of paper for hours?"</p>

      <p>She had to try out typing on one of these keyboards felt like. She had told mom, Angela, this, the only one of per parents who cared about this sort of thing. Angela mentioned that bet you someone made one on the lens. A smile had appeared on Star's face. For over the past couple months, Ky had been creating a room on her lens with her sister Ky and several of her other friends. She had met Trinity while she was in the computer history room on her lens and Logan in a discussion group about computer history on the lens. The four of them had been scouring the internet and found a group of others who were interested in the same thing and had already made several rooms with full haptic and visual simulation of using those computers running the old operating systems like Mac OSX Rainforest. The problem was, they didn't have the content for the old web pages. Star made it her mission to be able to find some.</p>

      <p>After lots of in depth research, she learned that one of the data warehouses for this company called Rackspace, which hosted a website that would store people's websites, called GitHub had a warehouse in Hong Kong. If she was able to get her hands on a hard drive of an old server, it would be in Hong Kong—and her family had already planned a trip there!</p>

      <p>Star plugged in all the hard drives into her lens as it slowly started to copy over the data and prepared to go to sleep---it had been a long day.</p>
      <p>When she awoke in the morning, she went into the lens room. Trinity because she was in San Francisco and Logan, because he was in Toronto, was already awake. They had already successfully taken the data from the hard drives and put it in a virtual server spec that they found. They connected the computers they had setup to the server. The first bit of information, on the hard drive, which in this old system, was divided into folders, was the website of this guy named "Jonathan Leung".</p>

      <p>They pulled it up on the computer they had seen their first page of back in the day. "Wow, they would just look at stuff like this all day? I guess it's kinda quaint, I could see why they could have liked it"</p>
